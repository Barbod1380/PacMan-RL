    "# 🟡 Introduction: Q-Learning for Pac-Man  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Overview  \n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a fundamental paradigm in artificial intelligence where an agent learns to interact with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. **Q-Learning**, a model-free off-policy algorithm, is one of the most widely used RL techniques for discrete state-action spaces. This notebook presents a Q-learning implementation for training an autonomous agent to play **Pac-Man** using **Pygame**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Goal  \n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop an **intelligent agent** that can navigate the Pac-Man environment optimally by learning from experience, without prior knowledge of the environment’s transition dynamics. The agent will iteratively refine its **Q-table**, improving its decision-making to achieve **higher scores and longer survival times**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔬 Why Q-Learning?  \n",
    "Q-Learning is particularly suitable for this problem due to its ability to:  \n",
    "✔ Handle **discrete** state-action spaces efficiently.  \n",
    "✔ Learn from **trial-and-error** interactions without requiring a model of the environment.  \n",
    "✔ Converge to an **optimal policy** given sufficient exploration and iterations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤖 How It Works  \n",
    "Q-learning operates by updating a Q-table, where each entry **Q(s, a)** represents the expected reward of taking action **a** in state **s**. The core update rule follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q(s, a) \\leftarrow Q(s, a) + \\alpha \\left( r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "- $s$, $a$: Current state and action.  \n",
    "- $s'$, $a'$: Next state and optimal next action.  \n",
    "- $r$: Reward received after taking action $a$.  \n",
    "- $\\alpha$ (learning rate): Controls how much new information overrides the old.  \n",
    "- $\\gamma$ (discount factor): Weighs the importance of future rewards.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent learns an optimal policy by iteratively refining **Q(s, a)** through experience, balancing **exploration (ε-greedy policy)** and **exploitation (greedy selection)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗 Structure of This Notebook  \n",
    "This notebook will be structured as follows:  \n",
    "1. **Environment Setup** – Defining states, actions, and rewards.  \n",
    "2. **Q-Learning Implementation** – Training loop, Q-table updates, and exploration strategy.  \n",
    "3. **Training & Results** – Running simulations, analyzing performance, and fine-tuning hyperparameters.  \n",
    "4. **Future Enhancements** – Exploring potential improvements such as function approximation (Deep Q-Networks).  \n"
